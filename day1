Important Point 1:
Course Policies - Communication Expectation: This is a transfer level college course and you are expected to use college level writing in all course communication.  This means I am expecting complete sentences and paragraphs that include appropriate capitalization and punctuation for e-mails, coursework, or any other communication.

My takeaway: Communication is key in the workplace (and generally in life), so practicing communication etiquette while in a class/group setting is great preparation for our future endeavors.

Important Point 2:
Assessment Work - Exams: Missed tests can made up ONLY by prior approval (24 hours or more) or documented emergency.  You are responsible for setting up the test makeup within 1 week of the missed test.

My takeaway: Deadlines are deadlines. Personal responsibility can make or break a career, so taking deadlines seriously will only help.

Question 1: 
In the context of this class, what is meant by the term “garbage collection?”

Question 2:
When testing and debugging our programs, will we also be practicing bug reports?

Interesting fact about me:
I have an AS Degree in Video Production and I regularly produce videos for local groups Butte Humane Society and Uncle Dad’s Art Collective.
